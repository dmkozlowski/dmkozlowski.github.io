        <div class="bio" id="drews">
          <p>Michael Drews started his accounting career in 1995 after receiving a bachelor’s degree in accounting and economics from Simon Fraser University. During the first part of his career he worked for several mid-sized regional firms most notably Bartlett Pringle and Wolfe in Santa Barbara.  After obtaining his CPA license Michael left public accounting and joined a technology company in Carpinteria where he worked as the Chief Financial Officer. The company grew and eventually employed over 500 employees.  It was the desire to be self-employed that led Michael to move to Camarillo from Santa Barbara and open his own firm in 2004. From the beginning, Michael’s primary focus has been on serving and providing tax services to individuals and small businesses.  In 2012 Michael expanded his practice and joined HDVest as a financial investment advisor after obtaining his securities license series 6 and series 7. He has continued to develop his financial expertise and business around providing financial and retirement planning services along with tax advice.    He enjoys the outdoors, watching and playing sports, especially ice hockey. Michael has served on the boards of numerous Camarillo organizations including the Chamber of Commerce, City of Camarillo, Rotary Club, CSUCI Financial Liaison and various Church Councils. He currently serves on the Executive Board of The Camarillo Ranch Foundation.  He is married to Amy for the past 20 years and has two teenaged children, Amanda and Derek.
