      <h2>Tax Returns</h2>
      <p>Preparing Tax Returns is the core of our business. Every year we prepare several hundred tax returns for Individuals, S-Corp's, C-Corps, Partnerships, Estates, and Fiduciaries
      We started out preparing tax returns and it is still the backbone of our firm. Every year hundreds of our clients visit us for an annual meeting to discuss their financial plans for the coming year and to have us prepare their tax returns.</p>

      <p>While some firms lose or churn clients every year, we take pride in the fact that our firm builds quality long term business relationships with our clients. As a result our firm has one of the lowest client churn rates in the industry. We believe that this is the best way to ensure that the client is getting the best possible tax advice and is paying the least possible under law. Furthermore by being involved with clients over multiple tax season we can plan tax strategies based on changing tax laws and the clients own unique situation. We care about our clients and it shows.</p>

      <p>We work to minimize your tax liability as much as possible, so you can keep more of what you have earned, building wealth for you and your family. A partial list of our tax services is listed here:
        <ul>
          <li>Individual tax return planning and preparation</li>

        <p>Many of the returns we prepare are simple individual returns where the clients simply want to trust their financial affairs to an organization that is more professional then the H&R Block type firms on the street corners. We welcome these people and our rate structure for these returns is comparable to H&R Block.</p>

        <p>The more typical client is someone who requires more specialized tax planning. It may be a doctor or dentist office, Insurance Agent, a small Camarillo business that employs 5-10 people or a home based business. This is really the area where our firm shines.
